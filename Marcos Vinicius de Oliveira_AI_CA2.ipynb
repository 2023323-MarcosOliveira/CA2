The nodes between `B` to `R`, represent the paths. `A` is connected to `B`, `C` and `H`, which means that from there, it can move in either direction of these stages. There are some random numbers on the edges, it can be the weights, the difficulty level of the puzzle and/or the cost of making this move.
