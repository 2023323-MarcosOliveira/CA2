## Question 1
A puzzle has multiple ways of reaching the end solution. **Fig. 1** shows a graph that represents all possible routes to the solution. The starting point of the game is represented by **A**, the solution is represented by **S**. The other points in the graph are possible intermediary stages.

#### Fig. 1
![alt text](/assets/Fig1.png "Fig. 1")

- A. The graph in Fig. 1 is a visualisation of the problem.
- B. Identify the differences between a graph and a tree. 
- C. Explain in detail how the graph is an abstraction of the problem.
- D. Identify the advantages of using a visualisation such as the one shown in Fig. 1.
- E. Demonstrate how Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm would find the shortest path to the solution in Fig.1 through diagrams and written explanation of each stage.

## Question 2
The creator of the puzzle has been told that the ***A**** algorithm is more efficient at finding the shortest path because it uses heuristics. Compare the performance of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm and the ***A**** search algorithm, referring to heuristics, to find the shortest path to the problem by implementing both algorithms programmatically and comparing the solutions generated in Mark-down. Refer to the complexity of the algorithms and compare the actual time it takes for the solutions to be processed.

### Solution
The answer to question 2 is attached and renamed as `Marcos Vinicius de Oliveira_AI_CA2.ipynb` and uploaded on Moodle and on GitHub.
